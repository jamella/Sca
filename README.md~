#Sca
Side Channel Attack on Operating Systems

#Sat 19 dec 2015
Finished basic signature collection
Signature Matching
Attack Process

#To Do
1) Improve Signature Matching
2) Improve Signature to take into account some caching(may be we can collect signatures directly from the browser we normally use instead of selenium...)
